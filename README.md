# Text Editor in Java Swing

## Overview

This project entails the development of a Java-based text editor with a graphical user interface using Java Swing. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly environment for text manipulation. The editor features a window (frame) equipped with a menu bar that includes two main menus: the File menu and the Edit menu.

## Features

### File Menu
- **New Window:** Opens a new instance of the text editor in a separate window.
- **Open File:** Allows users to select and open an existing text file.
- **Save File:** Enables users to save the current text content to a file.

### Edit Menu
- **Cut, Copy, Paste:** Standard text manipulation functions for selected content.
- **Select All:** Selects the entire text within the editor.
- **Close:** Closes the text editor.

## User Interface

The graphical user interface is designed to provide an intuitive environment for users to write and edit text. The window contains a text area where users can seamlessly input and modify text. The menus are neatly organized within the menu bar for easy access to various functions.

## How to Use

To use the text editor, users can download the provided source file and execute the `TextEditor.java` file. The editor will launch, allowing users to take advantage of its features for text editing and file management.

## Technology Used

This text editor is built using Java Swing, a powerful framework for creating graphical user interfaces in Java applications. The Swing library provides a comprehensive set of components and utilities to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the application.

## User Interface Snapshots

*Insert screenshots or descriptions of the user interface to give users a visual preview of the text editor.*

**Note:** Ensure that Java is properly installed on your system to run the text editor successfully.

Feel free to explore, enhance, and customize the text editor to suit your preferences!
